# Love Letter Helper

## Authors

Rhea Carillo, Amy Pierce, Jackson Gurney

## Overview

Our project will allow a user to compose a love letter and save it by title and recipient, it will evaluate the letter for positive or negative sentiment using an external API and return a score. It will then allow the recipient to edit the letter and re-score it, or delete the letter.
This project offers would-be Romeos and Juliets a secure place to compose and store love letters. It also gives writers who are uncertain of their skills some measure of how the object of their affection might receive their missive. Suitors may save letters, edit them, and rescore the edited version, or delete them.
